So I didn't see if there was anything specific to talk about this week.
I'm sure when we start making projects daily that will count as our commits, we just didn't have class yesterday so that makes it hard.
Alright, I see, my commits come from the coding I do, so I need to do more and will do more.
Tommorrow I will be starting create with code, I assume that will be my commits. I also did another powerup script yesterday, I think I did it right.
I forgot to code today, however I probabl will a little bit later tonight
