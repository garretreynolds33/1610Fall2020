Today is Wednesday September 2nd. 
I am goiong to start talking about Sport Scores now since the point is just to commit.
Today we are following the Golden Knights NHL team since I'm from Vegas. 
Yesterday they lost to the Canucks 2 to 1. 
However, they beat the Canucks 5 to 3 on sunday so there is a possibilty for progression with these guys.
Today I will be following scores from the NBA. 
I don't know mcuh about sports so do expect too much, however today we will be talking about the last couple Heat games.
Over the last couple days the Heats have played the Bucks and both times won, Monday with 115 to 104 and Wednesday 116 to 114.
Things are looking up for the Heat.
Friday, September 4th, it's a beautiful day.
In today's new, the MLB had  big game yesterday.
The Mets and Yankees went at it and the Mets came on top.
The score was 9 to 7 in the Mets favor, better luck next time yankees.
