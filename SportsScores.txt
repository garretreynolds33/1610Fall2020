Today is Wednesday September 2nd. 
I am goiong to start talking about Sport Scores now since the point is just to commit.
Today we are following the Golden Knights NHL team since I'm from Vegas. 
Yesterday they lost to the Canucks 2 to 1. 
However, they beat the Canucks 5 to 3 on sunday so there is a possibilty for progression with these guys.
Today I will be following scores from the NBA. 
I don't know mcuh about sports so do expect too much, however today we will be talking about the last couple Heat games.
Over the last couple days the Heats have played the Bucks and both times won, Monday with 115 to 104 and Wednesday 116 to 114.
Things are looking up for the Heat.
Friday, September 4th, it's a beautiful day.
In today's new, the MLB had  big game yesterday.
The Mets and Yankees went at it and the Mets came on top.
The score was 9 to 7 in the Mets favor, better luck next time yankees.
Alright today we are on the Clippers. They are facing off against the Nuggets
On thursday they faced off and beat the Nuggets, 120 to 97.
Tonight they face off again, we will see what happens next.
So today's scores are going to be made up.
We're just here to commit right? Also I had everything done for asignment 0 and totally forgot to turn it in Friday like an idiot.
So we will be talking about a pickleball game I played with some friends
It's very simple, the score was that I won and they lost, end of story.
I don't know what to talk about this week.
Tomorrow is class so I will get details, but here my commit.
